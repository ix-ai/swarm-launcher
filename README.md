A docker image to allow the launch of container in docker swarm, with options normally unavailable to swarm mode

## How it works

The image uses `docker-compose` to start a new project (see `LAUNCH_PROJECT_NAME`). You can either use the environment variables to configure the service started inside, or you can supply your own `/docker-compose.yml` file.

Either way, `swarm-launcher` takes care of the setup, tear-down and cleanup of the project.

## Supported architectures

The following architectures are supported by this image:

* `linux/amd64`
* `linux/arm64`
* `linux/arm/v7`
* `linux/arm/v6`
* `linux/386`

## Deprecations

**WARNING**: Due to the [introduction of storage usage quotas by GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/usage_quotas.html), the `registry.gitlab.com` images will **not** be updated anymore and will soon be removed. Please switch to either Docker Hub or GitHub (see below).

## Docs and Usage examples

See [Docs](docs/) and [Usage Examples](docs/usage_examples)

## Building the image

```sh
docker build -t swarm-launcher .
```

## Environment variables

The following environment variables are important, if you plan on using a private repository:

| **Variable**          |
|:----------------------|
| `LOGIN_USER`          |
| `LOGIN_PASSWORD`      |
| `LOGIN_PASSWORD_FILE` |
| `LOGIN_REGISTRY`      |

The following environment variables are important if you don't supply a `/docker-compose.yml` file in the swarm-launcher container:

| **Variable**            | **Default**                | **Mandatory** | **Description**                                 |

| `LAUNCH_EXT_NETWORKS_IPV4` | -                       | NO            | Similar to `LAUNCH_EXT_NETWORKS`, this is a space separated list of ExistingExternalNetworkName:Ipv4Address |
| `LAUNCH_EXT_NETWORKS_IPV6` | -                       | NO            | Similar to `LAUNCH_EXT_NETWORKS`, this is a space separated list of ExistingExternalNetworkName-Ipv6Address |

| `LAUNCH_ENVIRONMENTS`   | -                          | NO            | Space separated list of Key=Value pairs. **Note**: `@_@` gets replaced with a single whitespace, so you can expose environment values containing spaces. |
| `LAUNCH_ENVFILES`       | -                          | NO            | Space separated list of Key=Value pairs. **Note**: These files *must* be present on the host where the container is started|
